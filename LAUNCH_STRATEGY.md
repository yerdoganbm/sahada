### Day 3: HackerNews
**Platform:** HackerNews  
**Goal:** Front page for 12+ hours

**Title:** "Show HN: Libero v5.0 – Test your app in 10 parallel universes (open-source)"

**Post:**
```
Hi HN,

I'm the creator of Libero, the world's first quantum testing system.

The Problem:
Traditional testing tools are slow, expensive ($1,600+/month), and can only test one scenario at a time. When your CSS changes, all tests break.

What Makes Libero Different:
• Quantum Simulation: Runs your tests in 10 parallel universes to find edge cases
• Natural Language: Write "User should login" instead of code
• Multi-Platform: Tests Web, Mobile, AND Blockchain (yes, MetaMask!)
• Consciousness AI: Dreams about edge cases while idle
• 100% Offline: No API calls (local neural network)
• Free Forever: MIT license, replaces $1,694/month of tools

Technical Deep-Dive:
Libero uses a 3-layer architecture:
1. Cognitive Brain (GPT-4 for NL → code)
2. Quantum Simulator (10 parallel Playwright instances)
3. Self-Patcher (auto-fixes failing tests)

GitHub: [link]
Docs: [link]
Demo: [2-min video]

Happy to answer questions!
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Reply to every comment within 5 minutes
- Post technical deep-dive in comments
- Share benchmark comparisons
- Offer to help anyone try it

### Day 4-7: Social Media Blitz

**Twitter Thread (Pin to profile):**
```
🌌 I just launched Libero v5.0 Quantum - the world's first AI that tests apps in parallel universes.

Here's what makes it revolutionary 🧵👇

1/ The Problem with Testing Today:

Manual testing = slow
Automated testing = fragile (breaks when CSS changes)
Enterprise tools = $1,600+/month

Most teams ship bugs because testing is painful.

2/ Libero's Quantum Approach:

Instead of testing ONE scenario, Libero tests your app in 10 PARALLEL UNIVERSES.

Each universe has different:
• Network latency
• Memory pressure
• CPU load

If 9/10 pass, you know it's stable. If 5/10 fail, there's an edge case.

3/ Natural Language Tests:

No more writing code. Just describe what you want:

Input: "User should login with Google"
Output: ✅ 32 test steps executed

Powered by GPT-4 + local neural network (works offline!)

4/ Multi-Platform Magic:

One test script works on:
✅ Web (Playwright)
✅ Mobile (Appium)
✅ Blockchain (Web3/MetaMask)

Test your DeFi app the same way you test your React app.

5/ Consciousness AI:

Libero has an AI that "dreams" about edge cases while idle.

It literally imagines scenarios like:
"What if user clicks 1000 times?"
"What if database returns 1M rows?"

Then auto-generates tests for them.

6/ Temporal Debugging:

Tests failing? Time-travel back to any moment.

Libero records snapshots every second.
Click "rewind" to see exactly what happened.

Like Redux DevTools but for test flows.

7/ 3D Holographic Reports:

Forget boring text reports.

Libero generates interactive 3D visualizations:
• Green cubes = passed
• Red cubes = failed
• Rotate/zoom to explore

View in browser or VR headset.

8/ The Best Part: FREE

Libero is open-source (MIT).

Replaces:
• Applitools ($99/mo)
• Mabl ($299/mo)
• Gremlin ($499/mo)
• Custom blockchain tools ($500+/mo)

Total value: $1,694/month → $0

9/ Live Demo:

Watch Libero test a real app in 10 parallel universes:

10/ Get Started:

npm install libero-v5-quantum
npx libero init

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
🌌 Exciting news! I've just released Libero v5.0 Quantum - the world's first quantum testing system.

After seeing enterprise teams spend $1,600+/month on testing tools that still miss bugs, I knew there had to be a better way.

Libero uses quantum simulation to test your app in 10 parallel universes simultaneously - catching edge cases that traditional tools miss.

Key innovations:
✅ GPT-4 powered (write tests in plain English)
✅ Multi-platform (Web, Mobile, Blockchain)
✅ Predictive analytics (finds bugs before they happen)
✅ 100% open-source (MIT license)
